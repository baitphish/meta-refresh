1The method you are about to be introduced to is either mildly or heavily blackhatdepending on your offers terms, but the one constant is that it will take even someonewith virtually no start up experience or investment capital to instant revenue basicallyovernight and all while the CPA networks thank you for all of your great work.Like most of the systems I’ve constructed, this is a method that can literally take youfrom $0 to thousands of dollars a day in less than a month, and from $0 to $1000 a dayovernight.Most people believe systems like this, blackhat or not, do not even exist and thatmaking that kind of money with no real upfront costs this quickly is impossible.Not only is not impossible, I’ve used this method and many others to earn hundreds ofthousands of dollars a year with just a few hours a day management time.Like most people, you are probably of the common belief that for something to makeyou thousands of dollars a day it must be very complicated and in depth, and that beliefis why most people never make any money in this business.When is a 20 page guide worth $5000?When it will make you twenty times that without breaking a sweat.I’ve put the step by step together for you so you can see the structure, I’m going to gointo detail with you personally by phone so that you have a full understanding and aresetup correctly right away.The concept itself is quite simple:• Find real, fresh people every single day who will complete your offers for you.• Mix these people into real, targeted (but inexpensive) traffic to seamlessly blendthem in to your stats• Keep a normal conversion rate of 2‐5% to not raise suspicion• Reinvest a percentage of profits to scale up larger and larger while leveragingthose funds to move into white hat recurring revenue.If you follow all the steps below, you have bought yourself a ticket to a minimum of$1000 a day. 2Even better, the 3 to 5 hours of admin that this will take each day are dwarfed by theincome return but most importantly can be easily managed by an $8‐$10 an hour stafferwhile you reap the rewards.Creating a method like you are about to see is actually very simple, I’ve done it dozensof times and not because I’m any smarter than anyone else, simply because I know howto structure a system blackhat or otherwise to function correctly.When creating a system like this, the main goal is to know exactly what the CPAnetworks look for in a legitimate account vs. a fraudulent account.I am fortunate to have a very strong relationship with most of the major CPA networksas I do an average of $50,000 to $70,000 legitimately with them each month and havebeen given access to many important pieces of information which helped to constructthis very simple but thorough system.It’s as simple as “Give the networks what they want”. No more, no less.What I am going to show you should be used to build mass income quickly, but the truepoint of all this is to let the networks build your revenue streams for you with their ownmoney.Sounds a little crazy I know, but consider this:This method done right and kept quiet will allow you to build fast revenue. Revenue foryour wallet, but more importantly revenue to reinvest in quality traffic throughlegitimate media buys which will propel your earnings to a whole new level and all whileutilizing the networks money.So let’s take a quick look at what the CPA networks need to see:1. Real traffic – If you are running a US only offer (which most offers are) and thenetwork is seeing thousands of overseas IP addresses, Proxy hits, or duplicateIP’s they are going to assume something shady is going on with your account.2. A legitimate conversion rate – This should be pretty obvious, but many affiliatesare actually sending 3 conversions with only 4 clicks. The networks are not goingto believe that you somehow have the greatest converting traffic in the historyof internet marketing. 33. Verifiable leads – Many networks are now using lead verification systems to fightfraudulent submissions. These verification systems cross reference manystreams of data to make sure that a customer’s name, address, and phonenumber all match correctly.4. Good traffic sources – Now this one we can get around completely by being alittle crafty with how we present it (which will be discussed shortly), but manyaffiliates are sending tons of leads from the most god awful banner loaded pages(often free blogs) and they expect the networks to believe they are getting thismany conversions off a page most people wouldn’t even look at for more than aquarter second, let alone click any links on it.5. A good customer quality score – Merchants aren’t paying millions of dollars amonth for someone to enter in their name and phone number, they are payingmillions of dollars a month to obtain long term customers and revenue. If yousend 1000 leads and not one of them converts, that raises a pretty big red flagthat you are doing something not on the up and up with their terms of service.Now that we know that, we simply need to give them what they want.So let’s get to it:STEP 1Register for at least 20 CPA accounts. This will allow you to spread one new lead over 20separate offers on 20 separate networks, making each lead worth up to $1000 in CPAcommissions for the day.I’m going to show you how to get 30‐40 leads per day so if you’re doing the math, theincome potential is fairly incredible when scaled up.The other reasons we want so many CPA accounts is that it allows us to fly under theradar by only sending a few leads per day to each network, keeping our income on eachnetwork strong, but nothing that sticks out. 4Also, we like to make sure that on the extremely rare chance that we had an accountcancelled or have a network that is behind on payments or suddenly goes bankrupt, thatwe have multiple payments coming in from many different networks.There are quite literally hundreds of networks and private merchants paying CPA on alltypes of leads. I’ve included the ones I personally used for testing below, but there arenew programs out virtually every day which you can join and add to your list, so alwayskeep your eye out.If you don’t have it, I STRONGLY recommend getting Roboform for $20 as this will makesigning up for new networks and merchants a breeze with one push of a button.I also recommend using a service like StatsRemote to make life much easier. Thisdesktop application supports most CPA and merchant programs and gives you your livestats on all of them at once rather than logging into all of them each day to find outwhat you made in commissions.* ImportantThe following is some very important information regarding getting approved for CPAnetworks in less than a day, never getting turned down again, and starting your accountwith higher payouts than are even offered on the site immediately:1. Be a professional – You spent $5000 on this guide, so spend a few hundreddollars to look like a professional if you haven’t already.Most applications are denied these days because single affiliates are known for99% of the fraud on CPA networks. If you want instant approval, immediateaccess to exclusive offers not even listed on the site, Net 7 payments, and higherpayouts on every offer right away, then you need to be a company, not a person.This is all very simple and inexpensive, but these pretty little touches make you ahot ticket item when your application is being reviewed.First of all, spend the $60 to $90 and register a company with your state if youare not one already.It takes less than 24 hours in most states to receive your official registration andit can now be done online in less than ten minutes. Get a workable name for 5your online business ventures like “Lightspeed Marketing”, something thatmakes you sound like a marketing company.Once you have registered your new company name go tohttps://sa2.www4.irs.gov/modiein/individual/index.jsp and get your Tax ID foryour new business. This EIN number is what you will use to sign up to thenetworks with instead of your social security number, and you will apply as acompany, not an individual.Take your printed out EIN number and confirmation document from the state foryour business registration to your bank the next day and you will now have anofficial business account.Now you can apply to the CPA networks and merchants with your companyname and have them pay you in your company name by check or bank wire.When networks and merchants see that you are not only a company but amarketing company, they take your application much more seriously and make ita point to get you up and running quickly with their best payouts and offers.If you are not located in the US, then simply follow the procedure for registeringa business in your own country.2. Get a professional website and email address ‐ Most affiliates freak out when thenetworks ask what sites they promote offers on. If you simply have a genericcorporate site, you will be approved immediately and you won’t be expected toreveal any of your other sites (especially good if you don’t have any other sites).Take a look at a simple site like IntermarkMedia.com, it looks like every othercorporate site for an internet marketing company out there, and you can get analmost exact copy made with your own logo and text for less than $200 on a sitelike GetAFreelancer.com if you aren’t well versed in web design.Don’t apply to networks with gmail and hotmail accounts, I’m not saying youwon’t get approved, but I am saying that networks frown on these types ofsubmissions and these accounts are heavily scrutinized. 63. Get a phone line with a professional voicemail and don’t use a cell ‐ You can getSkype, or MajicJack, or any one of a thousand phone services with voicemail forless than $5 a month if you don’t have a spare line. Your voicemail should besomething to the effect of “Hi you’ve reached the desk of John Smith, I’m eitheron the phone or away from my desk, please leave me a message and I’ll give youa call back as soon as I can, Thanks”.Do not give them a cell number where you have a rap song playing for fiveminutes followed by a robotic operator saying “ To leave a voicemail press 1”.This really makes you look like an amateur.I personally recommend a service like TollFreeLive. You can get a toll freenumber with hundreds of extensions and 1000 minutes for $29.00 a month.4. Get an instant messenger ‐ (Preferably AIM and ICQ since this is what most affmanagers use) and a professional screename like JohnSmith or your companyname.5. Call the network/merchant the next day after you submit your application –Don’twork on their time frame, work on yours. Once you submit an application, grabtheir phone number and call them the next day if they haven’t already approvedyou.If you wait for them, it could take up to two weeks for an approval if there havebeen an influx of applications, and frankly, they appreciate pro‐active affiliateswho are serious about working with them.There are only two questions your application reviewer will probably ask you:1. How do you promote offers?2. What type of offers are you interested in?The answers are simple:1. I buy traffic and banner space2. I run all types of offers if they are converting well, I have access to a lot of trafficsources. 7The End.I know it may sound trivial to you, but from a lot of experience and a lot ofconversations with CPA networks, these few simple things will guarantee youracceptance and an affiliate manager willing to do whatever he or she can to help you.STEP 2And this is KEY. Now that you are approved for your networks, it is time to immediatelystart developing a daily friendly relationship with your assigned affiliate manager.This is so important as it almost ensures that you will never be banned out of thin air orlose a commission check as you know exactly what they are thinking at all times.Affiliates who hide or act like a shut in are the ones who get banned because thenetwork has no idea what they are doing.If you have never had an affiliate manager or been proactive in talking to your affiliatemanager, there is no need to be shy, these are very friendly people and it is in their bestinterest to help make you money.Most affiliate mangers are on AIM, so all it takes is sending them a quick IM saying “Hey______, I’m going to start sending some traffic to this offer as it looks pretty good, I’dappreciate any feedback you can give me, or if there is any room for a higher payout if itconverts well”Simple but effective.Your aff manager now knows you are going to be sending some traffic and potentiallyconversions, so they are not going to be surprised with your sudden activity.Beyond that, just by being proactive with him or her, you have shown that you are amore serious affiliate marketer and they are going to be interested in helping you.I can’t even tell you how many IM’s and phone calls I received each day from my affmanagers while testing this method basically begging me to run more offers for them orsend even more traffic for higher payouts. 8Believe me, if you get your aff manager talking with you briefly each day, it will make anenormous difference.Remember that the affiliates always perceived to be the ones committing fraud orviolating terms of service are the ones who are so secretive and hard to get a hold of.By putting your account right in their face everyday you basically show them “Hey, Ihave nothing to hide”.More than that, if there is a problem with anything you are doing, you will know rightthen and there and can make adjustments immediately, not just find your check missingfrom your mailbox weeks later.STEP 3Now we need to choose one offer on each network to run. What we want to look forare offers with a good CPA (Generally $20 or over) which is an easy completion (under 2minutes).Free trial offers are a great example, they often pay a $30 CPA for every customer thatpays just $5.95 or so for shipping and handling to take a trial of the product. Giving that$5.95 to the lead leaves you with a $24 profit.Other high paying offers that are good would be education requests for online collegematerials, debt consolidation, or fast quotes.I stay away from anything in depth like payday loans, mortgage, life/health insurance,etc because these forms can take forever to fill out, ask a ton of private information, andare just not worth the hassle when there are so many easier offers to run. 9STEP 4Now that we have our offers selected, we need to setup our traffic source so that ourleads are maintaining a normal conversion rate of 1% to 5%.There are two ways to do this, the easy way, and the hard way.Now the easy way is great, and I recommend it to anyone who needs or wants a fasttrack setup to get this going within the next few days.The hard way is my favorite because it truly gives the CPA networks/Merchants whatthey want to see from you to be blissfully happy with your traffic.The easy way will not get you in any trouble, just more questions from your affiliatemanagers, and I simply suggest that if you start off with it, you begin to migrate overwhen you can.The Easy Way:This will involve blocking your referrer so that the network can only see the IP addressesof each visitor, not where they actually came from.This allows you to buy traffic from cheap sources and then mix in the leads seamlessly.There are a ton of methods out there on referrer blocking, and you are welcome to useany of them however I would recommend our solution of OfferCloak.com for the simplereason that it works all the time, it’s been tested in the actual back ends of CPAnetworks, and most importantly it is a legitimate service that the CPA networksunderstand the use of.Purchasing this guide gives you a free membership to OfferCloak.com so take advantageof it unless you prefer your own methods.CPA networks do not like referrer blocking, and they won’t hesitate to tell you that.They want to know exactly where your traffic is coming from at all times. 10The good news is, the CPA networks are the ones that screwed it all up by being caughtstealing the traffic sources and landing pages of their affiliates to either promote theirown offers or help their other affiliates make even more money.Thanks to that kind of theft being well known in the industry, the networks now have noleg to stand on in demanding to know where your traffic is coming from.So we’ll now assume that your account is all setup on OfferCloak.com. If you are using adifferent method just bypass Step 1.Step 1 is to create an Offer Cloak link for each one of your affiliate links. The link that isgenerated is the link you will now use for both traffic and leads to be sent through.For traffic, I recommend Findology’s CPV option as we have worked closely with them tocreate even delivery of traffic throughout the day.Findolgy’s CPV traffic is 1 cent per view and if you are paying attention that means thatfor every 100 clicks you are only paying $1. So if you are sending 3 leads to your offersper day, you will only need to spend $1 to $3 per day per offer in traffic, and those threeleads will be making you $60 per day per offer...A very nice ROI.Another solution if you need to balance out traffic or for exit pop offers not accepted byFindology is BuyHitsCheap.com. Make sure that you buy only US unique traffic, not theweb hits package.The Hard Way:The hard way consists of buying banner space on contextual sites with decent traffic. Itcan take a week to month to set all this up depending on how versed in media buyingyou are.The reason I like this method slightly more than the other is that it eliminates referrerblocking and lets the networks see traffic and conversions coming through contextualsites which makes them very happy.Also, many great high paying offers only allow banner advertising, and obviously thisversion allows you to do that and promote those offers. 11To do it, you simply go to the Alexa directory and do keyword searches relating to theCPA offer you are promoting. So if it’s an anti‐aging skin cream trial, you would want totarget sites and forums that cater to women in their 30’s and 40’s who care about theirappearance.The Alexa directory lists sites in order of rank, so it’s easy to see which have the mosttraffic.Many of these sites already offer advertising space (and cheap) and the ones that do notI still contact anyway as most are very receptive and often times ecstatic that someonewants to buy ad space on their site.Typically I pay less than $25 for having 468x60 banner at the very top of their homepagefor a week. Most sites are just happy to have their hosting bill paid and make a fewbucks extra.The trick is to get on sites that will get you enough clicks, and in some cases I have hadto put a banner for the same offer on three sites to get enough clicks to make myconversion rate look right.Either way I’m spending less than $100 for the week sending impressions and traffic tothat offer and making hundreds more in profit.We don’t care if any of the clicks convert to sales as we are sending our own leadsthrough these banners, but in many cases you will actually get conversions from thesites real traffic which is a very nice bonus.As mentioned, this is the “hard way” as it takes a few weeks of playing around with toget right, but again, it makes the CPA networks very happy with your account and allowsyou to promote some great banner traffic only offers.I’ll work with you to make sure this is done correctly. 12STEP 6Getting the leads – Ahh the piece de resistance, how to get new fresh leads doing youroffers every single day.The premise is delightfully simple:Mystery ShoppersYes, Mystery Shoppers, and here’s how it works:Setup an incredibly simple site.....One of ours is SecretShoppersInc.com which we justripped the design from another site and had online in literally 11 minutes.This ugly site generates dozens of fresh leads per day with zero advertising costs.I knew that most people were going to need a free way to generate tons of fresh leadsso I developed the initial lead recruiting process using everyone’s favorite freesite......CraigslistI’m not talking about posting, so don’t get worried.I’m talking about the “Resumes” section. Tens of thousands of people each and everyday post their resumes or requests for part time work, and it so simple to recruit thesepeople into working for you that it is almost sickening.Simply pick any city on CraigslistType one of the following keyword strings in the search box:“extra money”“extra cash”“stay at home mom”“college student”“work from home”“part time”Now select “resumes” from the drop down box as which section you want to search. 13What comes up are anywhere from a dozen to a thousand new requests for extramoney positions, part time, work from home positions, and so on. There are dozens ofnew submissions from people looking for part time or at home work in every city everyday creating tens of thousands of potential “Mystery Shoppers” for you to leverage.The point is there are no shortage to leads who will be jumping at the chance to workfor you.These people want extra money, and they want it bad. The keyword strings I just gaveyou are the most effective in pulling out only the posts of people who are the bestcandidates for mystery shoppers.I’ve included the email I use to respond to their Craiglist postings with this guide so thatyou have an example to base yours off of.The posts that include a phone number, I recommend actually calling. We’ve included alive call audio file so you know exactly what to say to a potential shopper.When you present an online mystery shopping position to them that pays $9 per hour,they will jump at the chance to work for you.These are people that have no idea what affiliate marketing even is, and they are happyto fill out all of your offers with their real information, and real credit cards under thepremise that they are doing “Online Mystery Shops”.They are ecstatic to get free trials of skin screams, supplements, websites, onlinecasinos, and anything else you can give them an offer for.Probably the hands down best part of this is that the shoppers fully understand thatthey have to cancel any free trials that they do not want to continue.What I’ve found in my data is that many of these people actually continue some of thetrials such as Netflix, or diet pills like Hoodia, which actually gives you a good customerquality score.Some simply forget to cancel before they are rebilled, which is unfortunate, but theirown fault, and again this increases your quality score. 14The shoppers sign a very simple non‐disclosure agreement (included in your forms)stating under the threat of a lawsuit that they will never reveal their relationship to yourcompany even if asked directly by the merchant.This means that in the incredibly rare case that the merchant would ask directly wherethey saw the offer, the leads know that they cannot say they were incentivised orrewarded in anyway and can only say that they found it through regular onlinesearching.We instruct the shoppers to even pick up the phone and talk to the merchants in casewe need to send them a “Quality Survey” later which of course we never actually send.What this does is get that lead marked in the merchants system as real, and that theywere spoken to by phone, also contributing to your quality score.We simply tell the leads to ask for more time to think about the purchase or servicewhen the merchant makes the sales pitch. Later they can simply say they are notinterested or have gone with another company.While Craigslist is a wonderful free source for dozens of recruited leads each day, it’sstill work emailing all of them, taking phone calls to explain the process, etc.I recommend paying someone to do all this for you as soon as you can. An easier way isdriving traffic directly to your mystery shopping site.This involves pay per click and advertising costs of course, and you may need to wait afew weeks to do it so that you can use your CPA commissions, but the conversion rate isextremely high when promoting these sites.Also, considering the fact that one interested shopper is worth potentially $1000 ormore in commissions to you, so you can definitely afford to spend some money on payper click and advertising.I decided on $9 per hour because it is incredibly enticing to potential shoppers and mostmystery shopping companies don’t pay hourly, however you can experiment withdifferent numbers.A typical spreadsheet you will send each lead with all of your offers (included in yourforms) will take them less than two hours to complete, so you are only paying theshopper $18 at the max for the $1000 average you make in CPA commissions. 15Just do the math:20 offers at an average CPA of $25 is $500 in commissions per lead$3 per each of the 20 offers in traffic for the day is $60 leaving $440Paying the lead/shopper $18 to complete all the offers you have leaves $422Just three leads for the day gives you $1266 pure profit per dayPay a virtual employee $9 per hour to run the whole process and you and you walk awaywith $1194.00 per day pure profit without lifting a finger after the initial setup.With yourself or a staff member working full time, it is extremely easy to recruit, signup, and get 15‐20 leads a day doing your offers which would be $17,910 to $23,880 aday.I’m not suggesting you attempt those numbers initially at all; the key is to scale up. I’msimply showing you the potential.Don’t forget that those numbers were based on only 20 offers, and I was running 53while testing which would more than double your lead value right there.The only unfortunate part of the system is that you are always recruiting new freshleads each day to do your offers as the same lead cannot do more than one offer pernetwork without risking being questioned by the network.Unfortunately for the shoppers, they generally only get two days worth of sheets beforethey have completed all the offers that they can.In the end they will have gotten an extra $40 or more in their pocket for minimal work,and potentially some nice free trials.We also offered a $10 cash referral bonus for family and friends and suggest you do thesame. Each shopper referred an average of two additional shoppers to us which cost amere $20 to make an average of $2200 in profit.I’m betting that you would take that deal all day long.Generally we just tell the shoppers that we don’t have any more shops at the momentor are reconstructing the system and will contact them as soon as we have moreavailable. 16This way they are not surprised to not get additional sheets the following days and wecan immediately pay them their earnings and referral bonuses so they are happy.Leveraging Blackhat Income for Long term revenueAgain, the key here is long term revenue, and to pull a 180 into mostly white hat is veryeasy when you have a huge amount of capital at your finger tips.Can you commit $400 to $600 a day to real advertising out of the thousands you will bemaking?Of course you can.And doing this has multiple fantastic benefits:1. You are now acquiring very interested leads for your merchants which increasesyour customer quality score and ensures that you will be able to make long termmoney with them. You are basically using the merchants own money to get themcustomers while you make a hefty profit.2. You get to find multiple fantastic advertising sources. You don’t care if you aren’tmaking a profit on the traffic buys initially because you are simply acquiringadditional customers for your merchant to increase your quality score. If youonly make $200 back for spending $600, big deal, the point was to get morevalue to the merchant.The great advertising sources you discover while buying tons of traffic are priceless andthis is how I built the white hat income I make online every month. Blackhat methodsfunded my white hat marketing.Today I do a high five and even six figures a month with CPA and affiliate programslegitimately because I was able to use their own money to test thousands of trafficsources, keeping the top performing ones for future and continuing buys, and droppingall the ones that didn’t convert. 17It truly does take money to make money, and the CPA Domination method basicallygives your tens of thousands of dollars to build all your white hat long term incomestreams.What!!!?? We would never shave leads!!! <‐‐‐‐‐‐‐ Insert laughter here.If this is your first venture into the CPA game let me be the first to tell you about leadshaving as you are about to see it first hand.Some of it is accidental, a lot of it is intentional, but just about every network shavesleads, so get used to it.What is lead shaving?Simply the act of reporting less leads than you actually sent, and this saves CPAnetworks and merchants tens of millions of dollars in commissions per month...not abad racket.Remember that most affiliates should have no idea how many leads they are actuallysending to the CPA offers as that would be impossible under normal legitimateconditions.By incentivising, you know exactly how many leads should have showed up for the day.If you sent 8 leads through who completed the offer and only 5 are showing, you havejust witnessed the lovely trick of lead shaving.It’s a Catch 22 really, because you can’t just call your CPA network screaming that theyare shaving leads since they will then want to know how you could possibly have thattype of information unless you were breaking the terms of service.Now if you want to get slick, you could say you asked a friend to fill an offer after youhad an inkling that there were reporting issues, but this usually opens up a can of wormsthat will do you more harm than good.It’s a known fact that a lot of tracking software used by CPA networks (namelyDirectTrack) just drops 8 to 14 percent of leads just because it sucks. Other networksactually delay reporting of real time stats so they can shave a chunk off. 18It’s dirty, but in fairness, they really need to do it thanks to all the affiliates committingfraud with fake leads .Just be prepared to see a percentage of your leads unreported, you’ll still make a ton ofprofit.The song that never endsI tested this method for three solid months earning over $92,000 in profit and I received94% of the checks and bank wires I was owed.The few checks I didn’t receive weren’t even because I had an account banned, it wasbecause the network went belly up and left hundreds of affiliates hanging (these areusually adult sites and smaller networks).This can and will happen which is why you want dozens of checks rolling in to coveranything like this.If you are of the 1% that does get an account banned somehow, it’s nothing to be upsetabout it. A brand new account couldn’t be easier with all the handy tools availabletoday.If you are willing to spend a couple hundred dollars at the most, you can jump right backin with the same network and start making money again....Just be more careful thistime.A simple wireless card for your laptop will give you a new IP, a new phone number isless than $10, new site, new business name and tax id, and a mailbox service that willforward your mail and act as a new address.Over the years I’ve been banned dozens of times from dozens of networks testing allkinds of new strategies, and today I have accounts with all of them because it is thateasy to get right back on board. 19The Ugly TruthMost people don’t know that CPA Networks actually LOVE blackhat methods that breakterms of service.That’s right......Let that marinate in your brain for a moment.You see, CPA networks are in the business of making as much money as they can fromtheir merchants while still keeping them happy.That means that they can allow a fair amount of “less than desirable leads” into eachmerchant every day because the legitimate customers still make it profitable.Most affiliates are just plain greedy, stupid, or a combination of both. They make it soobvious that they are sending low level leads or worse, fake leads, that they are ofcourse banned immediately.Many offers do not allow incentivisation (which this method is) but it’s typically becausemost affiliate’s definition of incentivisation is “Hey dude, I’ll give you 5 bucks to fill outthis quote form for me”.Incentivisation actually works in some cases depending on the offer. In our case, we aregenerally picking free trial offers of things that consumers are crazy for.As we’ve seen, quite a few of the “Secret Shoppers” end up liking the product and ordermore, which is pretty amazing.The truth is I’ve actually explained this method to two top affiliate managers who workfor two of the biggest CPA networks around, and they were floored by its structure.Now these two have become personal friends of mine, I wouldn’t ever suggestmentioning something like this out loud, but they had no choice but to agree that it iscompletely undetectable as incentivisation using their research and fraud tools.They also begged me not to release it, however I explained that the point of CPADomination is actually quite white hat and beautiful which is rolling over into realadvertising. 20In theory, if the small number of you that were able to purchase this guide actually didreinvest profits and learn real media buying skills, both the CPA networks andmerchants would make far more money long term than you were able to make fromthem with the incentivised leads.Get your mind rightSome of you are thinking:“Wow $100,000 in just a few months! Imagine really scaling up!”Well let me say this...... $30,000, $50,000, $100,000 is MORE than enough to get youtons of white hat revenue streams in place, including legitimate advertising sources forCPA networks.This method isn’t meant to be used forever, it’s meant to lay the foundation of a muchbigger operation.If you are just going to start taking trips and buying fancy stuff when you get your firstbatch of checks, Internet Marketing isn’t for you.I’ve watched dozens of friends use my methods and some of their own to earn hundredsof thousands of dollars which they immediately blow on huge rented houses, cars,clothes and other luxuries only to be broke and worse off than they were beforebecause they made no effort to secure long term income with the profits.The finer things in life are truly amazing, and I partake in them because I’ve built a solidincome I can depend on.Invest first, buy toys later.Those first checks should pay whatever bills you need to, and the brunt of the moneyshould be spent buying legit advertising for the CPA offers you are running andobtaining other revenue streams such as buying profitable websites or creating productsof your own. 21A Few Other Seeds To PlantWhile the main focus of the method is quick CPA cash on higher paying offers, there aremultiple benefits that can be added in:GPT (Get paid to) Sites:Sites like Cashcrate and Gangstergreed are gold mines because the secret shoppers youare recruiting are looking for extra money.Most do not pay a CPA, some pay around a $1 per signup, but we don’t care about that.Just adding your referral link to the spreadsheets for each lead will do all the work foryou.These sites generally pay around 25% of what your referred members earn whilecompleting surveys and other small offers, as well as a percentage of any referrals theysend to the site.Just by adding these sites to the spreadsheets of about 63 leads, I’ve earned close to$1200 in commissions from them doing offers on the sites for extra money, and all ittook me was 3 seconds to paste in the links and instruct them to create a free account.Do this with all of your leads and many will be enticed by the whole “Get Paid To”scheme earning you some nice residual money.eBayOf course we all love eBay’s affiliate program. I’ve found that 2 to 3 out of every 10shoppers we recruit do not have an eBay account. There’s an easy $25 right there.Setup a BANS site on a domain and simply direct your leads to register to it and place abid on a new hot item just listed.It only takes you two seconds to ask the person if they have an account, and if theanswer is no, you just made a free commission. 22Guaranteed Sign UpsMost of these sites are garbage, and the sign ups are fake, however you can use yourever growing database of leads to run your own site.You can generally get $1 or more per lead depending on the situation, and you caneasily automate this with a website and cheap employee filling the sign up orders.Actual Mystery Shopping CompaniesJust for fun I made a few calls to actual mystery shopping companies online and offlineand two out of the four I contacted were very interested in a fresh database ofinterested shoppers.I didn’t bother striking up a deal since I only wanted to know if they would beinterested, but don’t rule out selling your database of leads to another company for arev share or per lead deal.Sell the siteYou have in your possession a secret shopping site with tons of shoppers signed up.Since you can easily make a new site a day if you wanted to, consider selling the entiresite as a turnkey for someone who wants to get into the business, or even offer the siteand leads to another company as mentioned above.Build a listAgain, just another income stream. These people are consumers, they buy things theydon’t need all the time hence why they are broke and looking for low level work likemystery shopping. They also fall for every trick in the book from free vacations to makemoney on autopilot. 23After your registration page, you can direct your leads anywhere, especially to a surveypage like most mystery shop companies do.You can ask as many questions as you like and believe me, they will answer them. Youcan ask their likes, hobbies, habits, job, anything.Huge companies pay millions of dollars to acquire this information because it is puregold.Knowing this allows you to cater offers to them for future mailings and future income.As your list grows you can rent it out to companies or other marketers when you don’thave an offer you want to promote.You are getting these people’s primary email, and from years of research and afterbuilding hundreds of lists I can tell you that these people do not change emails like wedo if the spam starts piling up.They talk to all the people in their life with this email, have probably had it for years andwill simply delete any spam that comes in.They will also rarely report you for spam if ever, and you can cover your bases by havingthe right to send emails hidden in your terms of service when they sign up.If you think a list of thousands of these leads and all their likes and dislikes isn’t worthspending a few minutes getting in place, think again, I’ve used many dirty list buildingtactics like this over the years and have made a very high six figures mailing them just afew times a month.Use your imaginationThere are many uses for these leads you’ll be acquiring each day, and you can probablythink of a few others right now.We will also be constantly updating buyers with any ideas we test and find to beprofitable. 24Get RollingYou’ve got the info, now we need to get you all setup and profitable.
